# Day 6 - Lists in Python

# Example: Creating and using lists

# Creating a list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Adding an item to the list
fruits.append("orange")

# Removing an item from the list
fruits.remove("banana")

# Accessing items by index
first_fruit = fruits[0]

# Looping through the list
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Output the first fruit
print("The first fruit is:", first_fruit)   
sort(reverse=True
)
